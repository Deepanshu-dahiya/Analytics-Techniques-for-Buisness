6.
Question 6
Use the AUC Calculator Spreadsheet.

AUC_Calculator and Review of AUC Curve.xlsx

Answer    No change 
7.
Question 7
Use the AUC Calculator Spreadsheet provided in question #6.

If the “modification factor” in the original example given in the AUC Calculator Spreadsheet is changed from -1 to -2, what is the threshold (row 10) that results in the lowest cost per event?

Answer  .45
8.
Question 8
Refer to the AUC Calculator Spreadsheet previously provided.

Assume a binary classification model is trained on 200 ordered pairs of scores and outcomes and has an AUC of .91 on this “training set.” The same model, on 5,000 new scores and outcomes, has an AUC of .5.

Which statement is most likely to be correct?

Answer    The original model identified signal as noise and has no predictive value on new data.

9.
Question 9
Refer to the Excel Linest Function Spreadsheet.

Excel Linest Function.xlsx
If a multivariate linear regression gives a weight beta(1) of 0.4 on x(1) = “age in years,” and a new input x(7) of “age in months” is added to the regression data, which of the following statements is false?

Answer    If the x(1) data are removed, the new beta(7) on the new x(7) data will be 0.4.
